Exercise 3: Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per
hour to compute gross pay.

Enter Hours: 35
Enter Rate: 2.75
Pay: 96.25

"""

hour = input("Enter hours: ")
rate = input("Enter rate: ")
# why there are a newline between two input functions.
pay = float(hour) * float(rate)
print("Pay:", round(pay, 2))

"""
We wonâ€™t worry about making sure our pay has exactly two digits after the decimal
place for now. If you want, you can play with the built-in Python round function
to properly round the resulting pay to two decimal places.
